Availability Estimate

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
- Incident happens
- CloudWatch triggers an alarm after some period of time: approx 5 minutes
- Because of multi-AZ configuration, automatically switch to another AZ where all required resources provisioned and running: less than 5 minutes
=> Minimum RTO can be around 10 minutes 


2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
- Incident happens
- CloudWatch triggers an alarm and push an on-call messages: approx 5 minutes
- On-call staff need some time to get prepared (get out of bed, get to a laptop, connect to VPN): 10 minutes
- On-call staff starts diagnosing the issue: 15 minutes
- Root cause is discovered: 10 minutes
- Remediation started (ex. promote read-replica): 10 minutes
- issue fixed: 10 minutes
=> Minimum RTO can be around 60 minutes


3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
- Incident happens (data loss started)
- Applications stop working (data loss stopped): approx 5 minutes
- AWS notices an incident and CloudWatch triggers an alarm and pushes on-call message: approx 5 minutes
- On-call staff restore service: 20 minutes
=> Minimum RPO would be around 5 minutes 
because data loss stopped after 5 minutes since the incident 
and automated backups and 5-minute transaction logs captures existed for recovery.


4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
- Incident happens (data loss started)
- Applications stop working (data loss stopped): approx 5 minutes
- AWS notices an incident and CloudWatch triggers an alarm and pushes on-call message: approx 5 minutes
- On-call staff needs some time to get prepared: 10 minutes
- On-call staff starts remediation: 10 minutes 
- Promote read-replicas into fully functional primary DB: 10 minutes
- Traffic rerouting started: 5 minutes
=> Minimum RPO would be around 5 minutes

Availability Estimate

1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
- Incident happens
- CloudWatch triggers an alarm after some period of time: approx 5 minutes
- Because of multi-AZ configuration, automatically switch to another AZ where all required resources provisioned and running: less than 5 minutes
=> Minimum RTO can be around 10 minutes 

2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage
- Incident happens
- CloudWatch triggers an alarm and push an on-call messages: approx 5 minutes
- On-call staff need some time to get prepared (get out of bed, get to a laptop, connect to VPN): 10 minutes
- On-call staff starts diagnosing the issue: 15 minutes
- Root cause is discovered: 10 minutes
- Remediation started (ex. promote read-replica): 10 minutes
- issue fixed: 10 minutes
=> Minimum ROT can be around 60 minutes

3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
- Because of automated backups and 5-minute transaction logs captures, data that would be lost is 5 minutes. 

4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
- Multi-region deployment, we could have multi read-replica. Because of replica lag, RPO can not be zero but very small. Lets say 1 minute.
